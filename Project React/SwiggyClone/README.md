## 🚀 Swiggy Website Clone (Frontend Focused)



 Just completed a frontend project where I recreated the Swiggy website UI with my own design updates and enhancements. The goal was to build a clean, responsive, and visually engaging interface that mirrors real-world platforms while sharpening my frontend skills.



## 🔧 Tech Stack Used:

 • React.js – for modular component architecture and dynamic rendering

 • Tailwind CSS – for rapid styling and responsive design

 • CSS – for fine-tuned visual control and custom animations

 • React Icons – for scalable, lightweight icon integration



## ✨ Project Highlights:

 • API-driven image rendering for dynamic content

 • Custom UI improvements for better accessibility and user experience

 • Mobile-first layout with smooth transitions and reusable components

 • Footer and homepage cloned with added tweaks for clarity and flow



## 🧠 Backend Setup:

 Since I’m currently focused on frontend development, I used AI to generate backend prompts that helped me configure API endpoints and simulate data flow—allowing me to stay productive without diving deep into backend logic.



## 📚 Learning Journey:

This project is part of my journey to master frontend engineering and build interfaces that are not just functional, but delightful. More updates coming soon as I refine animations, add toast notifications, and explore voice-enabled features.
