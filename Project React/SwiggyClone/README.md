#🚀 Swiggy Website Clone (Frontend Focused)



 Just completed a frontend project where I recreated the Swiggy website UI with my own design updates and enhancements. The goal was to build a clean, responsive, and visually engaging interface that mirrors real-world platforms while sharpening my frontend skills.



#🔧 Tech Stack Used:

 • React.js – for modular component architecture and dynamic rendering

 • Tailwind CSS – for rapid styling and responsive design

 • CSS – for fine-tuned visual control and custom animations

 • React Icons – for scalable, lightweight icon integration



#✨ Project Highlights:

 • API-driven image rendering for dynamic content

 • Custom UI improvements for better accessibility and user experience

 • Mobile-first layout with smooth transitions and reusable components

 • Footer and homepage cloned with added tweaks for clarity and flow



#🧠 Backend Setup:

 Since I’m currently focused on frontend development, I used AI to generate backend prompts that helped me configure API endpoints and simulate data flow—allowing me to stay productive without diving deep into backend logic.



#📚 Learning Journey:

 I’m learning React as part of my side hustle, while consistently practicing Java with DSA every single day. For those who say learning more than one  languages together in programming isn’t easy —I’m living proof that it is. Discipline, curiosity, and consistency make it work.



This project is part of my journey to master frontend engineering and build interfaces that are not just functional, but delightful. More updates coming soon as I refine animations, add toast notifications, and explore voice-enabled features.
